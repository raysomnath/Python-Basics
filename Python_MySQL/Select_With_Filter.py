# When selecting records from a table, you can filter the selection by using the "WHERE" statement:

import sys
import mysql.connector

# Try connecting to database "mydatabase"
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="Somshona$1",
    database = "mydatabase", 
    auth_plugin = 'mysql_native_password'
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE address ='Park Lane 38'"

mycursor.execute(sql)

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

for x in myresult:
  print(x)
